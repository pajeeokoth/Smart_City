Exploratory Analysis of Tree Maintenance in Paris France 
# Dataset Overview:
## This project is on tree planting and maintenance in the city of Paris.
 Trees are planted to provide green spaces in the city where residents and tourists can enjoy the outdoors, to clean the air of pollutants and improve rain water management. The city of Paris prides itself in the wooded heritage with more than 200,000 trees planted in the streets, green spaces and city facilities. With another 170,000 trees to be planted by 2026 making the city of Paris one of the most wooded cities in Europe. Being in the city, these trees require a different approach to maintenance compared to tree in the wild or designated forest lands. Because of the unique location, the city monitors tree development to replace dead ones and to ensure that newly planted ones are able to grow and be healthy.


 For this project we will analyze data the city collects and maintains on the health and conditions of the trees. We will use Python, Jupyter NoteBook, and python libraries i.e. Pandas, Seasborn, matplotlib etc to analyze the data.
